v0.1-beta.0
--------------------------------------------------------------
- Add Features
  - 1 import and export multiple json files in phm
  - 2 add option description to script details
  - 3 manage pop up message bars (ex. save phm pops up do you wish to save phm - obviously you do)
  - 4 close tab when script is deleted from script tree
  - 5 add schema item to script tree to make editing it simpler
      - add another root node to seperate schema from scripts
  - 6 edit windows so main window can be accessed while preferences is up
  - 7 make so ctrl-s saves all scripts then save phm. link to 3
  - 8 add whether the last run was successful or a faliure
  - 9 add reports to board after run. (run successful, run complete with failures - show the failures, etc)
  - 10 run one document in script by highlighting and selecting run in context menu

- Error:
  - 1 error when saving phm and save the first but not the next - the second is overwritten
  - 2 error checking when validating script in editor - validation error is no caught correctly

Further Down the Line:
--------------------------------------------------------------------

- terminal module that can be used with api calls to add data to scripts that can be ran at a later
  date when the user wishes to run.
  - User will be able to create phm files and scripts and target which script and phm file the wish
    to insert the data into.
  - have a limit or thresh hold where the data is automaticly sent to the database when reached
    Ex) after 10 documents added to script send to database
        after 3 scripts added to group send group to database
  - also have the option of sending direct to database and add to script
